## Abstract Project Cescription

In an initiative to enhance the workflow at the University Hospital Zurich's Molecular Tumor Profiling (MTP) Laboratory, our project focused on digitalizing and streamlining key processes. We tackled the challenges posed by the reliance on multiple, isolated information systems and the extensive manual labor required in the "Order to Report" process. By integrating Camunda's workflow engine, we optimized the preanalytical stages, reducing manual tasks and improving data consistency. This was augmented by incorporating tools like Make.com for automated data processing and client communication, and Deepnote for executing Python scripts for specialized tasks. Our efforts culminated in a more efficient, precise, and responsive workflow, setting a blueprint for further optimizing laboratory processes and enhancing client communication, particularly in cases of interrupted DNA analyses. This project demonstrates the potential of digitalization and system integration in transforming complex healthcare workflows.

## Introduction

#### Background

In this project, we confront the challenge of enhancing real-life processes within the Molecular Tumor Profiling (MTP) Laboratory at the University Hospital Zurich (USZ), a central unit in the Pathology Department. The MTP Laboratory plays a crucial role in genetic sequencing analysis, processing various sample types such as formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks, extracted DNA/RNA, blood, and bone marrow samples. In collaboration with other departments at USZ and an external evaluation site, the MTP Laboratory provides essential genetic analysis services, significantly contributing to diagnostics and research. With the advancement of DNA sequencing and complex diagnostic techniques, a deeper understanding of cancer is now more attainable. A well-structured process, from order intake to report delivery, is vital to support physicians and researchers in their work. The University Hospital Zurich, a leader in these diagnostic procedures, has established an "Order to Report" process essential for creating medical reports based on initial orders and subsequent DNA sequencing. We take the "Order to Report" process as the starting point for our project.

#### Goals

Our project aims to enhance collaboration and data exchange across different stages of the laboratory workflow, striving for a more integrated and responsive system. The goals are:

1. To automate process steps that currently involve significant "manual labor".
2. To eliminate existing "dead ends" in the current processes to improve process quality.

#### Methods

The following steps were undertaken for this project:

1. Analysis of the "Order to Report" process in consultation with a project member working at USZ to create an AS-IS BPMN process and identify challenges and optimization opportunities.

2. Utilizing insights from the analysis to model a TO-BE BPMN process as a proposal for a more streamlined process.

3. Selecting a section of the TO-BE process and using the Camunda workflow to implement automation to address the identified challenges.

#### Tools

The following tools will be used in our project:

**Camunda:** This serves as the core modeling tool and workflow engine. It manages the overall workflow, including orchestration, integration, and communication within the process. Camunda handles various functions, such as webhooks, RESTful APIs, and JavaScript. Additionally, it is responsible for managing external tasks in the workflow.

**Make:** An online automation platform, Make.com plays a major role in coordinating and processing data received from Camunda. It acts as a bridge, particularly between Camunda and Google Sheets, facilitating data transfer and handling the necessary formatting or data transformations. Make.com also automates the task of updating Google Sheets with new data and is utilized for automating email notifications.

**Deepnote:** In this platform, the Python script for the external task worker is developed and executed. This script, specifically designed for the "Calculate Sample Result" task in Camunda, automates decision-making based on predefined criteria for each sample type. It enhances efficiency by automating the manual task of cross-checking a sample against a checklist to assess "Sample Quality" before starting genetic analysis.

**Google Sheets:** Used as a simulated database for storing and organizing data. Each worksheet in Google Sheets represents a different information system, such as the Pathology Information System, Laboratory Information System, and Order Management System.

#### Result and Conclusion

Our review of the University Hospital Zurich's (USZ) "Order to Report" process revealed a significant reliance on multiple information systems and communication channels. The creation of an AS-IS Process Model from this analysis provided a comprehensive view of the existing workflow, covering stages from order and sample registration to processing, analysis, external evaluation, and client reporting. A notable aspect of this process was the presence of multiple branching points and its dependency on several isolated information systems.

With the **AS-IS** process model, we were able to identify some **key challenges**, including the complexity of the workflow due to diverse departmental information systems, the substantial manual effort required for maintaining data consistency, and if not done correctly could lead to hidden "dead ends" since some tasks are reliant on process data. We also discovered the absence of automated client notifications during intricate DNA analysis stages (preanalytical and analytical).

In response to these challenges, we identified the need for a more streamlined workflow. We concluded that digitalization could substantially enhance process efficiency by automating manual tasks and ensuring uniform data consistency across all systems. These enhancements aim to quicken the workflow, reduce manual entry errors, and improve overall efficiency. Additionally, given the critical nature of genetic analysis, we implemented an automated notification system for clients in instances of interrupted analyses, thereby improving customer satisfaction with timely communication. Based on these insights, a TO-BE process model was developed.

In this project, we focused on optimizing a specific segment of the **TO-BE** process model, particularly the preanalytical stages and client notification. Utilizing Camunda's workflow engine as the central orchestrating element, we effectively managed and controlled the workflow sequence. This was augmented by integrating **HTTP connectors and external tasks**, enabling the incorporation of external systems such as Make.com and a **Python-based external task worker** developed in Deepnote.

This integration streamlined data transfer and processing, thereby reducing reliance on manual tasks. Potential "dead ends" due to missing data necessary for continuation of certain tasks could also be minimized by improving **data consistency throughout different information systems**. Another critical improvement was the implementation of **automated email notification** through the integration between Camunda and Make.com. This setup enabled the automated generation and dispatch of emails, potentially enhancing client communication efficiency, especially by providing timely updates and status information on DNA analysis in cases where their orders are aborted. Overall, these advancements not only demonstrate that digitalization and integration can lead to a more efficient, precise, and responsive laboratory workflow but also establish a blueprint and a starting point for potential further optimization of laboratory processes in the MTP Lab at the USZ.

## AS-IS Process

This chapter provides insights into the AS-IS process and its identified issues. This Model is based on "Order to Report" process from the USZ.

### Process Model

![as-is process model](00_Assets/AS-IS_Process.png)

### Roles

_Patient Management_ The patient management is responsible taking care of administrative task regarding lab work such as processing orders and checking the order contains all necessary information.

_Accessioning_ The accessioning responsible is handling incoming samples including tasks such as registrate and check samples.

_Lab technician_ The lab technician is doing the actual work in the lab by processing the samples.

_Bio informatics_ Runs algorithms on the sequenced data from the lab.

_Clinical Operations_ Responsible for correct creation of analytical reports that will be sent to the client.

### Process Description

The process start with an internal or external client sending a request for a disgnosis order by email to the mailbox of the lab.

#### Order processing

**Process Order** The order is viewed in the mail and processed and checked if the important information is available.

**Register Sample-Order** The sample order is registered in the central pathology system. Internal orders will execute a sample extraction process from the patient. With external orders the patient material is directly acquired by the client.

**Sent extraction kit** For external orders a special box is sent to the client where the patient material will be sent back to the lab.

**Receive sample** The process is on halt until the sample phyisically arrives at the lab.

**Register sample** The incoming sample is registered in the laboratory system and the status of the order is updated in the order management system.

**Check sample** The sample is checked against certain criteria. If the sample does not fullfil the criteria the order is aborted. If ok the sample enters the lab.

**Check order form** A formally correct form has to be sent by the client for a sample to be sequenced. E.g. all information has to be correct and includes a signature consent by patient and physician.

#### Lab process

**Start Pre-Analytics** The sample is prepared for the lab process, that highly depends on the type of the processed patient material.

**DNA/RNA Extraction** The DNA/RNA is extracted which will be used for further analysis. The lab process can halt here until the order form is validated.

**Sequencing** The rna/dna is sequenced.

#### Post lab processing

**Sent sequencing data** The sequenced data is sent to external partner for generating a report.

**Finalize report** The report from the external partner is validated and finalized.

**Send report** The report is sent back to the client, that finishes the process.

#### Abort order

The abort order process can be triggered by multiple processes if e.g. the order form is uncomplete or missing for too long. Or if the sample fails in the lab process.

### Identified Issues and Problems

- The order is digitally processed in different systems. The user has to use different systems and even copy certain data from one system to another by hand. A workflow management system could be used to centralize the workflow implementation and provide a single user interface to do the work.
- Updating the order status has to be done by hand and needs to be automatized. This includes cancelling or aborting a order.

## TO-BE Process

This chapter provides the optimized process with the related benefits and improvments.

### Process Description

The TO-BE Process improves the steps from _Order processing_ as described in the AS-IS Process. Everything else is out-of-scope for this project.

#### Process incoming sample

After the sample is ordered, the process waits until the sample physically arrives:

- **Receive Sample** The process has a interrupting timer boundary event that fires after 30days going to the **Abort Order** processing. The user can check the incoming sample and continue the process.
- **Register Sample** The user enteres additional data belonging to the sample.
- **Save Data** The service task enters the sample information in the LIMS, where it will be used in laboratory processing.
- **Update order status** The service task updates the status of the order to _Sample Received_ in the Order Management System.

If both updates where successful then the process continues.

#### Abort Order

Throughout the course of the procedure, there are various instances where an order may need to be aborted. These include:

- Incomplete order forms due to missing data.
- Failure to meet the criteria for sample acceptance.
- Non-receipt of a sample for more than 30 days after the order is placed.

If a reason to abort the order occurs, the process transitions to the user task 'approve order abort.' The lab's head assesses the validity of the abortion and adjusts the automatically passed failure reason if necessary. Once the validation is complete, the order abortion is automatically recorded in the system, and the client is promptly notified through an automatically generated email. Subsequently, the entire process is terminated.
